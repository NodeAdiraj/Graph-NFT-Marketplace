Introduction

The NFT Marketplace Graph Indexer is designed to index blockchain events related to NFTs. This enables the frontend to efficiently query historical and real-time data. The Graph protocol provides a decentralized and performant solution for indexing and querying blockchain data.
Features

Event Indexing: Index key events such as NFT minting, transfers, and sales.
GraphQL API: Expose indexed data through a GraphQL API for easy querying.
Real-time Updates: Automatically index new events as they occur on-chain.
Data Persistence: Store and serve historical blockchain data.
Technologies

The Graph Protocol: Decentralized indexing and querying protocol for blockchain data.
Ethereum: Blockchain platform for smart contracts and NFTs.
GraphQL: Query language used to interact with the indexed data.
IPFS: Distributed file system used for storing subgraph deployments.
Setup

Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd nft-marketplace-graph-indexer
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
Authenticate with The Graph:
Obtain an access token from The Graph and authenticate:
bash
Copy code
graph auth --product hosted-service <access-token>
Configure Subgraph:
Edit the subgraph.yaml file to configure the smart contract address, ABI, and event handlers.
Usage

Generating Code
Generate the necessary code from the subgraph manifest:
bash
Copy code
graph codegen
Building the Subgraph
Build the subgraph to prepare it for deployment:
bash
Copy code
graph build
Deploying the Subgraph
Deploy the subgraph to The Graph hosted service:
bash
Copy code
graph deploy --product hosted-service <your-username>/<subgraph-name>
Querying the Subgraph
Once deployed, you can query the subgraph using the GraphQL endpoint provided by The Graph hosted service.
Subgraph Structure

The subgraph is structured as follows:
subgraph.yaml: Defines the data sources, entities, and event handlers.
schema.graphql: Defines the GraphQL schema for the entities.
src/mappings: Contains the event handler functions that map events to entities.
Key Entities
NFT: Represents an NFT with attributes like id, owner, tokenURI, and price.
Transaction: Represents a transaction involving NFTs, including buyer, seller, and price.
Key Event Handlers
handleTransfer: Handles the Transfer event to update NFT ownership.
handleSale: Handles the sale event to record transactions.
Deployment

To deploy the subgraph, ensure you have configured the subgraph.yaml file with the correct smart contract addresses and events. Then, follow the steps in the Usage section to build and deploy.
